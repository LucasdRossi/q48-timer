# :tv: Demo

# :information_source: How Q48 works

Is a series of exercises aimed at accelerating the metabolism.  
You need to start doing **20 seconds** of an exercise, run stopped for **10 seconds** and repeat the sequence afterwards with another exercise

# :saxophone: Sound effects

Sounds are played at random whenever you need to switch from exercise to running and vice versa.
